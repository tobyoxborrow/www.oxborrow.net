A screenshot of Neo-Tokyo as requested by bse.

[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) 2.2 was recently released. 
[screenshots](https://web.archive.org/web/20030206071430/http://vhost.dulug.duke.edu/~louie/screenshots/2.2/).

[Progress and Future of Mozilla-the-application-suite](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203654/http://mozilla.org/status/app-suite-progress-future-2-2003.html). 
Mozilla's improved so much since version 1.0. 
And something that completely went by unnoticed by me is the 
[Midas extension](https://web.archive.org/web/20030211014117/http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midas-spec.html)
([Demo](https://www-archive.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/)). 
IE has a similar propriatry extension, 
this appears to be Mozilla's own implimentation, again propriaty. 
From cursory glance it uses a similar naming scheme, 
so I'm guessing they are aiming to make it easy for people 
who've used IE's own method to extend their implimentations 
to include Midas. I'll have a go at upgrading the comments 
system to Midas and probably my Admin area... sorry, CMS too.

[bigcalm](https://myrant.net/) pointed me to [String::Approx](https://metacpan.org/dist/String-Approx)</a>, 
so I'll probably add a spell chekcer widget to the comment system and my backend.

[Tachyon-TV](https://web.archive.org/web/20030211092331/http://www.tachyon-tv.co.uk/)
it hasn't updated for about a month but I'd thought I'd send them some hits anyway, quality satire.
