As a Christmas treat, I got Da Red Gobbo and Bounca.
I don't collect greenskins, but the limited edition model looked too good to pass up.

I used [Dana Howl's Glazing and Underpainting technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A13JfFJxtIg).
I like the result, however, though the red coat and Bounca are different they are still perhaps too similar.
If I were to make changes, I would probably try and make them more distinct, perhaps a darker red coat and more orange in Bounca.
