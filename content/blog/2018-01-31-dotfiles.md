I've created a repository for the minimum dotfiles I would like to use across pretty much any host.

This includes configuration for things like bash, vim, git, fzf, golang, wget, etc.

On any new host, I just need to run:

```Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tobyoxborrow/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/
$ bash ~/.dotfiles/dotfiles.sh
```
