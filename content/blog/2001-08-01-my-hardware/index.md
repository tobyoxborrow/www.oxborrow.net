My home network currently consists of four computers, made up of three workstations and a firewall.
The Network is TCP/IP based, with each computer connected to my eight port hub, although my recent addition to my network, nikita the laptop, can optionally connect via it's WiFi interface so I can stroll around the house (annoyingly not as far as I would like) and still stay online.

The naming I used for the PCs started out with Anime characters, but now I'm going to stick to character's from Luc Besson films, my next pcs of sorts will no doubt be named either 'Leon' or 'Mathilda' and I'm determined to have an 'Uncle Bob'.

Workstations:
- wataru (main desktop pc, slackware linux)
- nikita (sony vaio laptop, slackware linux/windows 2000)
- andy (windows 98 client)

Servers:
- akira (firewall/router, smoothwall)
