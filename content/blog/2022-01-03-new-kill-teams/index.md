My friendly local game store had an end of year sale and since I've done such a good job on my backlog I think it's okay to pick up a few more future Kill Teams.

- Grey Knights - Strike Squad
- Custodian Guard Squad
- Sisters of Silence
- Harlequin Troupe

Annoyingly, the harlequins box is not enough models for a full troupe in Kill Team, so I've order some 3rd party prints to fill the remaining spots.

The Grey Knights can be Grey Knights, but I was also keen to have some renegade space marines and thought the Grey Knights might suit acting as Relictors. Both are grey and have a thing for demons.
