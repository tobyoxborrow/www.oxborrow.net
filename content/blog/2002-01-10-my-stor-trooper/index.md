Somebody pointed me in the direction of [stor troopers](https://web.archive.org/web/20020126005545/http://www.stor.co.uk/stortroopers_e.jsp), little avatars you can create that resemble yourself, so, I present you with the first (and only) picture of me on the site (and spenny):

PS: I took liberties and changed, hair colour, glasses tint and tux logo in Photoshop cause the applet didnt quite have what I wanted.

PPS: Hot & Spicy Pringles dont taste very spicy.
