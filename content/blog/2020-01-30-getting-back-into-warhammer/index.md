It's been a while...
Kill Team looks like a great way to get back into the game. Small teams, shorter games. 
I decided to pick up some Dark Eldar, they hadn't been introduced when I last played. 
I had always like Eldar, so thought the Wyches box set would be a good start.

It was probably a mistake to choose a race that is as small. It was very hard to put together and very hard to paint.
The colour scheme is okay... but could be better. I didn't bother with the faces. I'll probably redo them in the future.
