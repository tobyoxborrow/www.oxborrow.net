My {{< resource text="ACPI events handler script" src="20030803_acpi_events_pl.txt" >}}
and my {{< resource text="ACPI power mode toggler" src="20030803_acpi_pwr_pl.txt" >}}
(call it, it'll determine what power mode you're in (using simple test that WFM) and be more power saving accordingly) for use with ACPID.

I have master plans for rewriting my CMS for this site, remove sections I never update (network), 
redo sections I never update but get looked at a lot (code) and bring and make WrapDBI, my perl DBI er... wrapper up-to-date with my ASP version.

After playing with HTML::Template I find it's lack of includes a huge bad point, 
keeping multiple templates in sync (eg. the content between to ) a real nightmare if I was to use it in anything more than my test. 
I will look into other templating options, there's still others out there, or write my own, but I'd rather not.

I also have plans to make a 'lite' theme for my site (for small devices like ipaq, just for 
[neuro](https://web.archive.org/web/20030803232636/http://neuro.tk/)) 
and one other which hopefully should look good, if not you'll never see it :p
