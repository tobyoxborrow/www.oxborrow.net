Streaking Grime is an enamel effects paint. The use is simple and the result is amazing, but not like the standard acrylic paints.

1. Ensure the base layer is dry before proceeding. Then apply the Streaking Grime across the whole miniature, ensure it reaches the deepest, hardest to reach crevices. All your hard work painting will look lost at this point.
1. Remove the grime from raised areas with mineral spirits, gently using a brush, cotton buds or cloth. The shape of cotton buds means they don't reach recesses, and can soak up a lot, so great for this task. But the cotton is very abrasive and has a tendency to strip away paint, so be gentle. Using a brush is preferable as it doesn't seem to strip as much paint.
1. Compare model with other models to ensure grime consistency.
1. Allow to dry overnight.
1. In general there should be no need to apply streaking grime on the base. I'm going for a rubble/dusty look. But could be used on metal parts on the base.

One problem I encountered was that it may desaturate the previous colours. 
I only noticed this after I had already finished a lot of models and started painting a new batch.
There is probably a way to avoid this, maybe waiting longer for the enamel to dry or using less mineral spirits. 
Since the rest of the models already have this effect, I wanted to maintain it for consistency. And besides, the desaturated Kantor Blue is a good look too.
So now I need to force the desaturation effect in some cases. For example when removing enamels more carefully, now the Kantor Blue is still its normal self.
Or when touching up with the original colour, those touch ups will look different.

To create a desaturated blue, add orange. So for touch ups I use the following:
1. Kantor Blue + Vallejo Bright Orange
1. Add Vallejo Glaze Medium.
1. Apply enough coats as needed.
1. Avoid paint seeping into crevices. Use a separate brush, dry, to wick up excess paint.

This is not ideal, it is more steps. So I hope to avoid doing that, but have the technique for when I need it.
