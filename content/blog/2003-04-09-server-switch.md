This site has moved server rather slowly and with a lot of problems but is finally in England, 
continuing its world tour which started 2 years ago in America this very month. Rock on.

Every script on this site had to be changed, 
hardcoded paths == bad thing(tm). 
And for some reason they all needed user +x permissions 
whereas before they were world +x. 
But what a good excuse to upgrade to v4. 
I can think of none other, so here it be. Enjoy.
