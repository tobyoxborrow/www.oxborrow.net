Today was Okazaki's Fireworks Festival. I was advised a good spot to see the show, on the top floor of a nearby carpark. When I got there it was already full of people but I found a good place to watch from.

Thanks to Okazaki being a long-time producer of fireworks for the whole of Japan, they were able to put on a good show. 2 and a half hours long...

今日は岡崎花火大会が開いた。友達に見る場所を教えてもらった。それは近くにある駐車場の３階だ。着いたら、もう人がいっぱいけど、空いている所を見つけて、楽しんだ。
