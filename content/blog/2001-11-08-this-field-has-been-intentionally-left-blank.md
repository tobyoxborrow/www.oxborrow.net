3 weeks, 5 days, 1h 07m 41s since I last updated the site huh... ok, lets reset that.

Well within the last week I've been quite a busy bee working on the [ExB](http://exb.sf.net/) project. 
The most major thing I did was make a new look website, knock up the rather dandy logo and fill the site with 
some content, which is now the responsibility of [Xenith](https://web.archive.org/web/20020207110623/http://xenith.org/). 
Next up has been coding madly on RSSMod for the project that will allow the bot to report news items 
into an IRC channel. 
News items such as CNN, slashdot, News Forge and The Register.

Next most interesting thing that happened was I bought [Run Lola Run](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827) a very cool movie, 
lots of eye candy, very unique. 
The soundtrack had me tapping my toes the whole time... so I went out and bought that too.
