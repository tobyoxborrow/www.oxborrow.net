Got bored waiting for Gentoo 1.4 so I installed one of the release candidates 
onto my laptop (also because i fried the laptop with one misplaced command). 
So far, very good, all the niggles I had about the installation procedure are 
gone from 1.0 (not having a vi like editor, no fat support for mounting partitions, 
i810 network card driver didnt work too well, not having cfdisk).

More fun than that tho was me killing some bordom by playing with ChatZilla and getting faces for the peeps in #humour. 
I did this based on the code for 
[moznet faces](https://web.archive.org/web/20020925130516/http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/faces.pl).
Not sure if I'll use ChatZilla fully, it is missing some features that I'd find hard to live without. 
Oh well, you can see {{< resource text="a little screenshot" src="20020924_chattin.jpg" >}} of some chatting with faces.
