All of my coursework has been handed in as of yesterday, in total seven pieces. 
Of those only four have been markedâ€¦ My best score so far has been 86 for a critical appraisal of another student's work. 
The scores I've seen haven't been bad, generating an average of 77.3 (with a standard deviation of 7).

A "first" is awarded to any score over 70. 
This puts a lot of pressure on me to maintain the level for the remaining presentation and four written exams. 
While the presentation shouldn't be *that* difficult, I've never done any written exams since my GCSEs. 
The prospect is not exactly exciting me.
