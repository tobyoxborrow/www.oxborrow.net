Some firstborn space marines to join my Primaris Crimson Fists.
I had start them in March, and finished a few, but only recently got around to finishing them all.

These came from Ebay.
The previous owner had probably use plastic cement, melting some of the models around the joins, losing some detail.
Like the Primaris, I cut what I could with a hobby saw to adjust poses.

Firstborn have access to more weapons than Primaris, so I used some misc. bits from Ebay, plus a Sterngard Veterans set, to give them a variety of weapons.
Since they are shorter than Primaris, I also used tactical rubble to make them a bit taller.
