The latest revision of this site is before your eyes, 
[CGI::Application](https://metacpan.org/release/MARKSTOS/CGI-Application-4.50/) based, 
because I thought it looked cool, and what do you know, it is.

For some unknown reason, 
I disallowed "/" in the robots.txt. 
I had wondered why my site vanished from Google, now I know why.

Green. 
I've had a quick fiddle with the colours, 
in case you forgot, 
it was primarily red before. 
New site icon too, a picture of spencer. I doubt it appears in MSIE.

The <span style="text-decoration:line-through">Gallery</span> is back and it has a lot more pictures. 
I've also adding groupings. There is even a search.
