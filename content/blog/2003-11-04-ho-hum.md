Have got myself the games Tron 2.0, and BF1942 expansions Road to Rome and Secret Weapons of WWII. Not had much chance to play them yet.

The Smart Playlists when on the iPod are smart, 
I thought they wernt but I wasnt paying attention. 
bse told me a new smart playlist that I find useful 
"Unheard" (Play count = 0), of which I have 730, or 2.4 days worth. 
I've also added "Unheard - Rated", 
for the odd times I've rated a song but not heard it (currently have 7 like that).
