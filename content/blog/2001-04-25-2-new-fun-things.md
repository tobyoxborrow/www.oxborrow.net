I've just finished making the [weblinks](https://pinboard.in/u:tobyoxborrow/) part of the site, which is normally hidden away under the about, I've added a lot of links, I think about 30, which fills up 3 of the sections, I'll add more over time.

I think I'm addicted to [black & white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_White_(video_game)).

I'm also passing the time writting a little irc chatter bot in perl (to run via the [X-Chat](https://web.archive.org/web/20010801204900/http://www.xchat.org/) irc client), affectionatly named watBot, he's looking promising. I will post his source on here when he's reached an acceptable level of compleation.
