And for my next trick I shall steal a couple of links from [zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/)...

For those of you like me who don't have a shred of colour co-ordination, there's the 
[QuickColor widget](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602141127/http://kohaistyle.com/scripts/quickcolor/). 
Set your initial colour and it will generate a six 
colour palate that works well with your choice.

A nifty [Color Blender](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/), 
select two colours and it will generate a selection of colours between the two.

And while I'm on about useful web building resources, the 
[DevEdge Sidebar Tabs](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602211628/http://devedge.netscape.com/toolbox/sidebars/)
are ultra useful.

Isn't it fun when a simple jpeg can 
[break Internet Explorer](https://web.archive.org/web/20030623074645/http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=003j8d).
