I got myself all worked up recently by playing a ton of 
[ArmageTron](https://armagetron.sourceforge.net/), 
an amazing game with simple rules but fast gameplay. 
If you ever wanted to play the light cycle game from the movie Tron, 
this is defiantly the one to try (and I've played a lot of light cycle clones, it must be the most cloned game ever). 
The movie pack on their addons page adds the extra oomph needed to make you feel like the movie. 
(to be honest, the default look is really really bad, so I highly suggest getting the movie pack
if you try the game out, which I also highly recommend, its great fun single and multiplayer).

Oh and as promised,

plain and simple.
