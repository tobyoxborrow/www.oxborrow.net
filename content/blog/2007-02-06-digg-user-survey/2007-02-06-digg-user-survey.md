As part of my University course I am doing a survey of democratic news aggregation websites like Digg.

If you are a Digg user, I would appreciate your feedback:

<span style="text-decoration:line-through">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=789133258588</span>

Update: The survey is now closed. Thanks to all 1400+ who participated.

The [quick output of the results]({{< resource src="digg_survey_summary.html" >}}) are available, 
these do not include the responses to text questions.
This is the output of surveymonkey's HTML export function.
