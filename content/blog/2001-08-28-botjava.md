ExB [http://exb.sf.net/](http://exb.sf.net/) is an [IRC](https://foldoc.org/Internet+Relay+Chat) 
[bot](https://foldoc.org/bot) that's abilities can be expanded by adding modules.
It's written entirely in Java, which means it is fully OS independent (a great feature in any program).
I've been coding like crazy making modules for this, 
which has allowed me to learn a great deal about the [Java](https://foldoc.org/Java) language, 
for which I had no previous experience.

I hope to use Java in the future instead of MICROS~1 [Visual Basic](https://foldoc.org/Visual+Basic).
