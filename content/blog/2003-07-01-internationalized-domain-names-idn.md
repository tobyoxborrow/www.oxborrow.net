This [devedge article](https://web.archive.org/web/20030723132052/http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/idn/) is a pretty good read on a 
pretty nifty new underlying web structure to be put in place. 
Basically, countries that don't use the Latin character-set no longer have to put up with our inferior letters and can use their own.

Demo featuring 
[Western European characters](https://web.archive.org/web/20030723132052/http://www.nunames.nu/eu-lang-test.htm), 
[Japanese characters](https://web.archive.org/web/20030723132052/http://www.nunames.nu/lldemo/NUregistryJP-uni.htm).

Note: the only browsers to support this new standard are Netscape 7.1+ and Mozilla 1.4+, so you can view the demos in other browsers, 
but the links wont work and probably display an error message.

Some crazy folk [recreated a scene from Matrix Reloaded](https://web.archive.org/web/20030723132052/http://www.juergenspecht.com/truestories/matrixreloaded/) 
(the actual scene is right near the bottom, the rest are preparation shots). Well that's what they claim, but its not a scene I recognise.
