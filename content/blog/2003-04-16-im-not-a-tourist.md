Putting more effort into learning [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) via a very good 
[Introduction to Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618023611/http://www.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/ruby/0.2/). 
I now know how to assign values to variables, some arithmatic, the differences between strings, 
integers and floats and how to use a simple loop. Go me!
