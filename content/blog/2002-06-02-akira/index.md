I named the machine after possibly the most famous Anime[[?]](https://web.archive.org/web/20020606120215/http://www.tapanime.com/info/what.html) of all time... [Akira](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094625/) (and now, [after a long wait](https://web.archive.org/web/20020602142103/http://slashdot.org/articles/01/07/25/1213202.shtml) the DVD of which proudly sits on my shelf).

It's current location in my home is under my desk in my bedroom to my right as can be seen in the photos.
