{{< hero src="20021014_large_15.jpg" >}}

Havn't had a new screenshot online in ages, {{< resource text="here's nikita" src="20021014_large_15.jpg" >}}

Busy working on oxborrow.net mark 5 or wherever I'm up to, and this one I will finish. Completed checklist:

- Homepage
- DVDs
- Links
- Code
- PhotoLog
- Much improved Blog
- family tree

Still to do:

- About
- Backend CMSey thingy
- 404, 500, 403 carping

After I've done my site I'm gunna have a play around with 
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), 
having a Perl background it shouldn't be too hard to pick up.

Thanks to Lil_Sparky and his pointing me to 
[Flashback Abandonware](https://web.archive.org/web/20021119210716/http://www.flashback-aw.net/)</a>
I am now playing ultra cool 
[Dune 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20021119210716/http://www.flashback-aw.net/games.php?GameID=38) again. Too many hours lost.

Still no Gentoo 1.4, *kicks dirt*
