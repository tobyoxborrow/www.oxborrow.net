Well for starters, my site looks different. I've finally put the revamped code in place. 
The story behind the spencer picture is simple, someone didnt like what I had there in one of my earlier designs 
so I put her there instead, and noone argues with her. Still needs a little extra work but its mostly all in.

51 work units for 
[folding@home](https://web.archive.org/web/20021125075146/http://folding.stanford.edu/), yay. 
Just found out today it uses stole 50mb of memory on my work machine, 
not sure where it puts it cause it claims it (how many its?) only uses 5mb at most. 
So I've stopped running that now at work during working hours, since it was causing a huge strain on the system.

Playing around with [Pheonix](https://web.archive.org/web/20021203004121/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/)
at work and home. It definatly feels faster than mozilla, it's got some cute features too.
