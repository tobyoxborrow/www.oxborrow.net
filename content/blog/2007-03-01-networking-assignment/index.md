Last December I had a networking assignment to design a network for the University campus after it had been acquired by a fictitious company.

I got 72/100 for the assignment, which is a "first", or distinction.

I'm quite proud of the [poster](20070301_network_poster.pdf).

I've handed in two more assignments recently, I hope to get the marks soon.
