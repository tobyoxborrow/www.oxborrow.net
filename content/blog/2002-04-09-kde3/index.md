While I'm trying out this gentoo thingamy (its pretty dandy so far) I'm trying out the latest and greatest KDE. 
The latest version is mostly just an upgrade to the underlying libraries to the new QT version 3. 
But it does include some nice odds and ends.



I've taken a few screenshots to show it off. It looks great, but I've never liked the feel, its too overwhealming for my needs. 
I prefer the simplicity of Enlightenment or Fluxbox, but I'm giving KDE a try just so I know what I'm missing.
