I got some spam recently with the following subject:

> Re: %RND_UC_CHAR[2-8], my attendants

Apparently they havnt quite got their templating system sorted out yet.
Quite amusing reading the source code to see the lengths they are going to to stop anti-spam software. 
There are non-existant tags littered through the text to break up words so anti-spam software cant read the tell tell phrases.

> &lt;p&gt;Th&lt;/best&gt;e ul&lt;/intrude&gt;timate

Of course, any sensible a/s s/w would strip all html out before it read the message.

Tron 2.0 is great, one of the better movie to game er... games. 
Authentic sounds, and settings, the disc is the only weapon I use even though you have a multitude of others 
(I also played the whole of jedi knight 2 with the light saber, where available), just more fun than using a gun constantly. 
And all the computing references actually make sense, which is a rare treat.
