[The tallest virtual building in the world](http://www.mrwong.de/myhouse/index.htm). 
Well it was... when the site was working. I guess he got a little more traffic than he was expecting. 
That's what you get for creating a page full of images I guess. Lets hope it's back up soon.

GIMP 1.3.x development version looks hella good. 
The menus being attached to the image is a really good idea, IMO more usable than the right-click menus. 
The main buttons redesign now all in colour makes it much easier to find the tool you're looking for, compared to the greyscale ones from previous versions. 
And the tool and filter dialogs are all newly designed making them much more friendly.
