First the test, which went well I feel. The vocabulary section was clearly easier than previous years. 
Listening went a little worse than expected, but I feel I still could get a high score there. 
Reading and Grammar were as ever a race against the clock. 
The passages weren't all that difficult and I feel I understood them however answering questions about 
them in a short amount of time is another matter altogether. 
I had managed to speed up my reading however this year were three extra passages, 
so in the end I didn't have time for these. 
I expect I'll only have around 50% there as I've been getting previously. Grammar was a little surprising, 
I was able to answer a lot of questions very quickly, I think because I'm used to the patterns of some 
questions that I just have to read a few words and instantly I know what the answer is. 
Again, due to time constraints I couldn't answer all the questions here, but got through the bulk of them.

With the big test out of the way I have just three more weeks left in Japan. 
Most of this time will be occupied with packing and general leaving stuff. 
It's quite a task to look at a years worth of accumulated items and sort the stuff to keep and what to junk/sell. 
What's even worse is that its Christmas season, so I also want to send gifts back home for my family, 
thus accumulating even more itemsâ€¦

I have had a great long adventure in Japan and sure it will be a shame to leave. 
I will still pursue Japanese, through books and TV so I hope I won't loose what I've learnt. 
And next year I would like to take JLPT Level 1, so I shall study for that too.
